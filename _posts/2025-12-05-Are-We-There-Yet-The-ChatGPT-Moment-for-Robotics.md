## The ChatGPT Moment for Robotics: A Quick Overview  

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT are transforming robotics from rigid, rule-based systems into adaptable, context-aware machines. This short intro outlines how we moved from GOFAI-era logic to today’s language-powered embodied intelligence.

### Before GPT: The GOFAI Era  
- Robots depended on hand-crafted rules and deterministic logic.  
- Poor at handling ambiguity or unfamiliar scenarios.  
- Strong at narrow tasks but lacked true understanding.

### After GPT: The Paradigm Shift  
- Foundation models enable reasoning, generalization, and fluid dialogue.  
- Robots can decompose tasks, clarify unclear instructions, and adapt mid-execution.  
- Perception evolves into cognition — machines understand *why*, not just *what*.

### LLMs in Robotics Today  
1. **Task planning** from high-level commands.  
2. **Ambiguity handling** through interactive clarification.  
3. **On-the-fly code generation** for robotic behaviors.  
4. **Scene understanding** using contextual cues.  
5. **Natural language explanations** for decisions and errors.

### What’s Next  
- Multi-modal sensory fusion.  
- Continual learning beyond initial training.  
- On-device LLM deployment for faster, private inference.  
- Stronger ethical and safety frameworks for autonomous systems.
